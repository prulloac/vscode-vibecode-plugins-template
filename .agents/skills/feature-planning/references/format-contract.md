# Format Contract: Feature Breakdown → Feature Planning

This document defines the interface contract between the `feature-breakdown` and `feature-planning` skills. It ensures safe, predictable handoff of data from breakdown to planning.

## Purpose

The format contract ensures that:

1. `feature-breakdown` produces output that `feature-planning` can reliably consume
1. `feature-planning` knows exactly what to expect and how to parse it
1. If either skill changes format, both must be updated in lockstep
1. Tools can validate format compliance before planning starts

### 8. Next Steps

```markdown
## Next Steps

1. Use feature-planning skill to create timeline and resource plan
2. Follow the sequenced task list during implementation
3. Update progress in tracking system
```

- Instructions for next phase (planning)
- How to use breakdown during implementation
- How to report issues or changes

### Validation Script

```python
def validate_breakdown_format(file_path):
    """Validate that breakdown.md meets format contract"""

    required_sections = [
        "Executive Summary",
        "Component Architecture",
        "Implementation Tasks",
        "Acceptance Criteria Reference",
        "Validation Plan",
        "Completion Criteria",
        "Risk & Mitigation",
        "Next Steps"
    ]

    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Check all sections present
    for section in required_sections:
        if f"## {section}" not in content:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing required section: {section}")

    # Check section order
    section_positions = {
        section: content.find(f"## {section}")
        for section in required_sections
    }

    for i in range(len(required_sections) - 1):
        current = section_positions[required_sections[i]]
        next_section = section_positions[required_sections[i + 1]]
        if current >= next_section:
            raise ValueError(f"Section {required_sections[i]} appears after {required_sections[i+1]}")

    # Parse and validate tasks
    import re
    task_pattern = r"### Task \d+:"
    tasks = re.findall(task_pattern, content)
    if len(tasks) < 5 or len(tasks) > 50:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected 5-50 tasks, found {len(tasks)}")

    print("✅ Breakdown format validated successfully")
    return True
```

## Breaking Changes Policy

If either skill needs to change the format:

1. **feature-breakdown changes output**: Update this contract first, then update feature-planning
1. **feature-planning needs different input**: Update this contract first, then feature-breakdown
1. **Major version change**: Update version number in both skills
1. **Minor addition**: Document new optional fields clearly

### Version History

| Date       | Change                      | Breaking | Skills Updated |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| 2026-02-19 | Initial contract definition | No       | Both           |

## Examples

See `example-format-contract-valid.md` for a complete valid breakdown document that meets all contract requirements.

See `example-format-contract-invalid.md` for examples of invalid formats and what makes them non-compliant.

## For Skill Developers

**When updating feature-breakdown**:

1. Check this contract before changing output format
1. If output needs to change, update contract FIRST
1. Add version number update to SKILL.md frontmatter
1. Notify feature-planning maintainer of breaking changes

**When updating feature-planning**:

1. Check this contract for input requirements
1. If input expectations change, update contract FIRST
1. Add validation check to skill startup to catch format violations
1. Notify feature-breakdown maintainer of new input requirements

## Questions & Clarifications

**Q: What if my breakdown doesn't have 8 sections?**
A: feature-planning cannot proceed. Load feature-breakdown skill and regenerate breakdown until all 8 sections exist.

**Q: Can I skip sections?**
A: No. All 8 sections are required. They may be brief, but must exist.

**Q: What if I have more than 50 tasks?**
A: Consider breaking the feature into smaller features. 50+ tasks should be multiple smaller breakdown documents.

**Q: Can tasks have fewer than 2 acceptance criteria?**
A: No. Each task must have 2-5 acceptance criteria to be testable. If you can't write 2 criteria, the task may be too vague.
