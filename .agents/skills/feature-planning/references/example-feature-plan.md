______________________________________________________________________

## Batch 1: Backend Foundation

### Task 1: Create users database table

**Component**: Backend / Database

**Depends On**: None

**Parallel With**: None

**Description**:
Create PostgreSQL table for users with: id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at.
Add indexes on email (for login lookups).
Create migration file that can be run/reverted.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Migration file created and versioned
- [ ] Table has all required fields (id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Email field is indexed for fast lookups
- [ ] Migration runs without errors
- [ ] Migration can be reverted without data loss

**Integration Point**: Task 2 will use this schema to store hashed passwords

**Effort Estimate**: Small (\< 1 hour)

______________________________________________________________________

### Task 2: Implement password hashing & validation

**Component**: Backend / Authentication Logic

**Depends On**: None (can start independently)

**Parallel With**: Task 1 and 3 (doesn't need Task 1 to start, but Task 3 needs this complete)

**Description**:
Create password utility: hash(plaintext) → hash, verify(plaintext, hash) → true/false.
Use bcrypt library. Configure reasonable cost factor.
Include validation: min length, strength requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- [ ] Can verify plaintext against hash
- [ ] Validation rejects weak passwords (min 8 chars, requires uppercase + number)
- [ ] Cost factor set to prevent brute-force attacks (≥12)
- [ ] Unit tests pass (test hashing, verification, validation edge cases)

**Integration Point**: Task 3 will call these functions when users register/login

**Effort Estimate**: Small (\< 1 hour)

______________________________________________________________________

### Task 3: Create authentication API endpoints

**Component**: Backend / API

**Depends On**: Task 1 (schema) AND Task 2 (password logic)

**Parallel With**: None

**Description**:
POST /auth/register: email, password → user object
POST /auth/login: email, password → { user, token }
POST /auth/logout: → success
GET /auth/me: → current user (requires valid token)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] POST /auth/register: creates user, hashes password, returns user object
- [ ] POST /auth/login: validates credentials, returns JWT token with 24-hour expiration
- [ ] POST /auth/logout: returns success (or invalidates session)
- [ ] GET /auth/me: returns current user if token valid, 401 if not
- [ ] All endpoints return proper HTTP error codes (400 for validation, 401 for auth, 409 for duplicate email, etc.)
- [ ] API tests pass for all endpoints
- [ ] Token returned in proper format (Bearer token in Authorization header)

**Integration Point**: Frontend will call these endpoints

**Effort Estimate**: Medium (2-3 hours)

______________________________________________________________________

## Batch 1 Summary

**When to Execute**: After feature-planning completes

**Why This Batch**: Foundational backend work. Cannot proceed with frontend until these 3 tasks are done.

**Tasks Can Parallelize?** Task 1 and 2 can start independently, but Task 3 must wait for both. Suggested order: start Task 1 and 2 together, then do Task 3.

**Success Criteria for Batch**: All 3 tasks complete, all acceptance criteria met, API responding correctly to register/login/logout requests

______________________________________________________________________

## Batch 2: Frontend & Session

### Task 4: Build login/register UI forms

**Component**: Frontend / UI

**Depends On**: Task 3 (API endpoints must exist to validate against)

**Parallel With**: Task 5 and 6 (forms can be built while session management is built)

**Description**:
Create React components: `<RegisterForm>` and `<LoginForm>`.
Forms capture email and password, display validation errors.
Include "I have an account" link to switch between register and login.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] RegisterForm: email + password inputs + validation
- [ ] LoginForm: email + password inputs + validation
- [ ] Forms show error messages on invalid input (red text, clear messaging)
- [ ] Forms disable submit button while submitting
- [ ] Can switch between login/register views (navigation works)
- [ ] Forms are accessible (labels properly associated, focus indicators, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Component renders without errors

**Integration Point**: Task 5 will handle form submission (calling APIs, storing tokens)

**Effort Estimate**: Medium (2-3 hours)

______________________________________________________________________

### Task 5: Add session management (store tokens, refresh logic)

**Component**: Frontend / State Management

**Depends On**: Task 3 (API must return tokens to store)

**Parallel With**: Task 4 and 6 (can build session logic while forms are being built)

**Description**:
Create session utility:

- store(token): Save JWT token to localStorage
- get(): Retrieve token from localStorage
- clear(): Remove token from storage
- isValid(): Check if token exists and hasn't expired

Create user context to provide current user globally throughout the app.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Token stored in localStorage
- [ ] Token persists across page reloads
- [ ] Token cleared on logout
- [ ] User context available throughout app (useUser() hook)
- [ ] isValid() returns true if token exists and not expired, false otherwise
- [ ] Handles token expiration gracefully (redirects to login after 24 hours)
- [ ] Unit tests pass

**Integration Point**: Task 4 forms will call store() after login, Task 6 logout will call clear()

**Effort Estimate**: Small (1-2 hours)

______________________________________________________________________

### Task 6: Implement logout and cleanup

**Component**: Frontend / Navigation

**Depends On**: Task 4 (forms) AND Task 5 (session management)

**Parallel With**: None

**Description**:
Create logout flow:

- Add logout button visible when user is logged in
- Logout button calls backend POST /auth/logout
- Session token cleared from storage (via Task 5 utility)
- User context reset
- Redirect to login page
- Clear any user-specific state (shopping cart, preferences, etc.)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Logout button visible in header when user authenticated
- [ ] Logout button calls POST /auth/logout endpoint
- [ ] Token removed from localStorage
- [ ] User context reset to null/undefined
- [ ] Redirects to login page after logout
- [ ] User-specific state cleared
- [ ] Can immediately log back in after logout (no stale state)

**Integration Point**: Uses session management from Task 5

**Effort Estimate**: Small (1-2 hours)

______________________________________________________________________

## Batch 2 Summary

**When to Execute**: After Batch 1 completely done

**Why This Batch**: Frontend UI and session handling. Depends on Task 3 API endpoints being available.

**Tasks Can Parallelize?** Task 4 and 5 can start together. Task 6 must wait for both.

**Success Criteria for Batch**: Users can register, log in (token persists), and log out. Full auth flow works end-to-end.

______________________________________________________________________

## Batch 3: Integration & Testing

### Task 7: End-to-end authentication flow tests

**Component**: Testing / Integration

**Depends On**: Task 4, 5, 6 (all frontend complete) AND Task 1, 2, 3 (all backend complete)

**Parallel With**: Task 8 and 9 (different test areas, can run in parallel)

**Description**:
Write integration tests for the complete authentication flow:

- Test: Register new user → user created → can log in
- Test: Login with valid credentials → token returned → stays logged in
- Test: Logout → token removed → gets redirected → can login again
- Test: Access protected endpoint with token → returns user data
- Test: Access protected endpoint without token → returns 401

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Register-to-login flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Token persists across page reloads
- [ ] Logout clears token completely
- [ ] Can immediately re-login after logout
- [ ] Protected endpoints reject requests without token
- [ ] All test scenarios covered
- [ ] Tests pass (100% pass rate)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs tests

**Integration Point**: Verifies Batch 1 & 2 work together correctly

**Effort Estimate**: Medium (2-3 hours)

______________________________________________________________________

### Task 8: Security audit

**Component**: Security / Quality Assurance

**Depends On**: Task 1, 2, 3 (all backend) AND Task 4, 5, 6 (all frontend)

**Parallel With**: Task 7 and 9 (different audit concerns)

**Description**:
Conduct security audit:

- Verify passwords meet minimum complexity (8+ chars, uppercase, number)
- Verify tokens expire after 24 hours
- Verify no sensitive data in logs or console
- Verify no XSS vulnerabilities in forms
- Verify CSRF protection in place
- Check API for SQL injection vulnerabilities

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Passwords require 8+ characters
- [ ] Passwords require at least one uppercase letter
- [ ] Passwords require at least one number
- [ ] Tokens expire after 24 hours
- [ ] No passwords or tokens in logs
- [ ] Forms sanitize user input (no XSS possible)
- [ ] API validates all inputs
- [ ] Security checklist items all passed
- [ ] No critical vulnerabilities found

**Integration Point**: Quality gate for entire feature

**Effort Estimate**: Medium (2-3 hours)

______________________________________________________________________

### Task 9: Error handling and edge cases

**Component**: Quality Assurance / Robustness

**Depends On**: All previous tasks (tests edge cases across entire system)

**Parallel With**: Task 7 and 8 (tests different aspects)

**Description**:
Test error scenarios and edge cases:

- Duplicate email registration (should reject with 409)
- Case-insensitive email lookup (john@example.com = John@example.com)
- Concurrent login attempts from same user
- Network errors during registration/login (handle gracefully)
- Expired token behavior (redirect to login, don't crash)
- Invalid token format (should reject cleanly)
- Rapid successive logout attempts (idempotent)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Duplicate email rejected with 409 Conflict
- [ ] Email lookups case-insensitive
- [ ] Concurrent logins handled correctly
- [ ] Network errors don't crash app (show user-friendly message)
- [ ] Expired token triggers automatic redirect to login
- [ ] Invalid token format rejected
- [ ] Logout is idempotent (can call multiple times safely)
- [ ] All edge cases documented
- [ ] Tests pass

**Integration Point**: Robustness across entire system

**Effort Estimate**: Medium (2-3 hours)

______________________________________________________________________

## Batch 3 Summary

**When to Execute**: After Batch 1 & 2 both complete

**Why This Batch**: Comprehensive testing and security validation. Ensures the complete auth system works reliably and securely.

**Tasks Can Parallelize?** All 3 tasks (7, 8, 9) can run in parallel - they test different aspects and don't block each other.

**Success Criteria for Batch**: All tests pass, security audit passes, no critical vulnerabilities, feature is production-ready.

```

**Total Estimated Effort**: 14-20 hours (across 3 batches)

**Critical Path**: Batch 1 → Batch 2 → Batch 3 (cannot overlap)

**Parallelization within batches**:

- Batch 1: Start Task 1 & 2 together, then Task 3 (saves ~1 hour)
- Batch 2: Start Task 4 & 5 together, then Task 6 (saves ~1.5 hours)
- Batch 3: All 3 tasks simultaneous (saves ~6 hours)

## How to Use This Sequence

1. **Send to AI Agent**: Copy Batch 1 context and send to agent with instructions to execute all 3 tasks
1. **Monitor Progress**: As agent works, note any blockers or issues
1. **Verify Completion**: Check that all acceptance criteria are met before moving to next batch
1. **Handoff**: Provide Batch 2 context to next agent with notes from Batch 1
1. **Repeat**: Continue for Batch 3
