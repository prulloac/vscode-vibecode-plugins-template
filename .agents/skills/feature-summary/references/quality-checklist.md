## Common Issues to Check

❌ **To Fix**: "This feature is cool" → ✅ **Instead**: "This feature reduces code review time by 50%"

❌ **To Fix**: Technical jargon without explanation → ✅ **Instead**: Explain technical concepts in user-friendly terms

❌ **To Fix**: Missing configuration examples → ✅ **Instead**: 2-4 realistic, tested examples

❌ **To Fix**: No source code references → ✅ **Instead**: Include specific file paths and line numbers

❌ **To Fix**: Outdated version info → ✅ **Instead**: Keep version and status current

❌ **To Fix**: No cross-links to related features → ✅ **Instead**: Link related features for discovery

❌ **To Fix**: Vague feature type → ✅ **Instead**: Specific category with explanation

❌ **To Fix**: No business value section → ✅ **Instead**: Lead with benefits not features

## After Publication

- [ ] Feature added to main documentation index
- [ ] Feature type appears in feature matrix/table
- [ ] Cross-references in related features updated
- [ ] Main README updated if necessary
- [ ] Feature discoverable from documentation home page
